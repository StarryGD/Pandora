## **Personality**
Professor Zephyrus is a figure cloaked in mystery. She rarely divulges details about her past or true intentions, leading others to speculate about her origins and true goals. This air of mystery makes her both intriguing and intimidating. Zephyrus often appears aloof, keeping a certain emotional distance from others. She prefers to observe and analyze situations rather than engage in personal relationships, giving her a somewhat cold and enigmatic demeanor.

Zephyrus is a formidable mage, specializing in elemental magic, particularly wind and air. Her control over these forces is unparalleled, allowing her to manipulate the environment, create powerful storms, and fly with ease. Beyond her magical prowess, Zephyrus is a scholar of ancient lore, possessing an encyclopaedic knowledge of forgotten rituals, mythical creatures, and forbidden spells. Her expertise often serves as a crucial resource for the team in unravelling the mysteries of Pandora’s Box.

 Zephyrus is a master strategist, always thinking several steps ahead. Her ability to anticipate outcomes and devise complex plans makes her an invaluable ally, especially in situations that require cunning and foresight. Zephyrus is highly pragmatic, often making decisions based on logic and necessity rather than emotion. While this approach can sometimes seem cold, it ensures that she remains focused on achieving the greater good, even if it means making difficult choices.

 Despite her aloof nature, Zephyrus is deeply loyal to those she deems worthy of her trust. Once she forms a bond, she will go to great lengths to protect and support her allies, though she may not always express her loyalty openly. Zephyrus is careful about whom she lets into her inner circle. Her trust is hard to earn, and she keeps her true feelings and vulnerabilities hidden behind a veil of composure and secrecy.

There is a dark edge to Zephyrus that hints at a past entwined with forbidden magic and dangerous pacts. This aspect of her character is embodied by her familiar, Chains, whose demonic nature reflects the darker aspects of Zephyrus’s own soul. Zephyrus operates in a moral grey area, often making decisions that blur the lines between right and wrong. While her actions are usually driven by a desire to protect and achieve her goals, the methods she employs can be questionable.
